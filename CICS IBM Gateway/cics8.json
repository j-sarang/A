Authorization failure using servlets with WebSphere
A user ID and password authorization failure can occur
for servlets that use the IBM® WebSphere® autostart
function. This is indicated by a message in the JNI trace.
SymptomThe following message appears in
the JNI trace:
 CcicsECI: Authorize userid/password
with RACF. Return code = -1, errno = 157

Probable causeServlets that use the WebSphere autostart
function do not have the required authority to access CICS® Transaction Gateway.

ActionUse "user-driven" servlets.
With these the initialization is performed in the servlet's init() method.

Gateway daemon startup fails due to dirty address space 
The Gateway daemon fails to start because the
address space where it runs has previously been used for running non
program-controlled code.
SymptomThe Gateway daemon fails
to start with the following error:
CTG9549E Gateway
daemon failed to start, see Gateway error log; the log location  is
defined by configuration file file name

Probable causeThe CICS® Transaction Gateway HFS (Hierarchical
File Store) is mounted with NOSETUID.

ActionEnsure that HFS is mounted with the
default of SETUID.

Loss of connection with unit of recovery in doubt
A network connection between IBM® WebSphere® Application
Server and the Gateway daemon is terminated while a UOR is in doubt.
This results in an ATR229D write to operator with reply (WTOR) message.
SymptomA WTOR message similar to the following
is written to the system log: 
0000 *NN ATR229D
CANCEL DELAYED. REPLY WAIT, BACKOUT, OR COMMIT TO RESOLVE INDOUBT
UR. URID = UR identifier. 
Where NN is
a number for the operator to reply to and UR identifier is
a URID.

Probable causeA network connection between IBM WebSphere Application
Server and the Gateway daemon is terminated, when a UOR is in doubt.

ActionNo further action is required because IBM WebSphere Application
Server reconnects automatically and resolves the transaction.
When IBM WebSphere Application
Server reconnects to the Gateway daemon, or to any other Gateway daemon
in the group, and issues a commit or backout request, the transaction
is resolved, the WTOR is cancelled, and the following message is written
to the log: 
10:45:09.23  00000010  IEE400I THESE
MESSAGES CANCELLED - NN
The
connection manager thread that was dealing with the network connection
that failed stays blocked until the UOR is resolved and the message
cancelled.
Note: If you do reply to the message
with BACKOUT or COMMIT before IBM WebSphere Application
Server has reconnected and resolved the transaction, a heuristic hazard
error is returned to IBM WebSphere Application
Server. In this case it is your responsibility to ensure that transaction
integrity is maintained.  You should not respond to this message but
instead, allow IBM WebSphere Application
Server to resolve the transaction.
