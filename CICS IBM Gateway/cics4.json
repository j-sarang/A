Memory use increases over time
The amount of memory used by the Gateway daemon might
increase over time and a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception might occur.
The maximum number of connection manager threads and worker threads
is defined in the CICS® Transaction Gateway configuration.
SymptomThe Gateway daemon stops responding and the JVM writes
a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception to the stderror log file or to the Java™ dump file. The JVM also creates
various dump files in the information log. There is probably no noticeable
decrease in performance before the problem occurs.  If you happened
to be monitoring memory usage before the dump occurred, you would
have seen that memory usage gradually increased over time until eventually
the limit was reached.

Probable causeThere is a problem with a user-written application, for example
a request exit which has remained inadvertently connected and is using Java resources.
There are too many active Java threads
(connection manager threads and worker threads).
The Java heap size is unnecessarily
large. Because the memory required to create Java heap and Java threads
is allocated from the same finite storage area, it is possible that
making the Java heap too large
could indirectly cause a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception because there
would then be insufficient memory available to create enough Java threads.
The Java heap size is too
small.
The CICS REGION
size is too small.



ActionIf there is a problem with a user application, ensure
that the application practices good memory management techniques,
such as freeing resources when they are no longer required. 
If the Java heap size is
unnecessarily large or too small, set the maximum amount of heap memory
available to the JVM by using the -Xmx option. The default heap size
specified by the CICS Transaction Gateway is
128MB.
Run a memory usage monitor against the Gateway daemon process. 



Additional informationThe way that Java allocates memory depends on
your JVM implementation. Most JVMs allow you to adjust the maximum
amount of heap memory and adjust the amount of memory allocated to
each thread.
The amount of memory that Java allocates to each thread is set by using
the -Xmso and -Xss options. Do not change the Java stack and native stack sizes from their
default values.
For more information on thread limits see Threading model. For more information
on Java memory allocation and
JVM stack sizes, see the IBM® Java Diagnostics Guides Information
Center.

Message DFHEX0003 following startup
After CICS® Transaction Gateway initialization
completes, message DFHEX0003 is displayed with System
completion code=878 Reason code=00000010 and CICS TG stops.
SymptomA 64-bit CICS TG is configured with a region size of
300M. The following messages may be written to the log:IEF403I CTG900 - STARTED                                                                
BPXM023I (CTGPERF) CTG6400I CTG900   CICS TRANSACTION GATEWAY IS STARTING               
BPXM023I (CTGPERF) CTG6512I CTG900   CICS TRANSACTION GATEWAY INITIALIZATION COMPLETE   
+DFHEX0003  A GETMAIN request in module DFHXCPRH (code X'0617') has failed. Reason X'04'.

IEA705I ERROR DURING GETMAIN SYS CODE = 878-10 CTG900 CTG900 00

.
   693             SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=878  REASON CODE=00000010                    


Probable causeThe REGION size is too small.
The 878-10 abend indicates an out-of-memory condition.
The DFHEX0003 message "A GETMAIN request
... has failed" also indicates a memory problem.

ActionIncrease the REGION size. For more
information on performance and tuning, see Tuning the Gateway to avoid out-of-memory conditions and Memory setting on IBM z/OS

OutOfMemory(OOM) error due to lack of native memory for thread creation
The total amount of native memory used by the Gateway daemon increases per thread. 
In 64 bit java every thread running in AMODE64 requires at least 3MB virtual storage above the bar for its stack storage and control blocks.
SymptomThe Gateway daemon stops responding and the JVM writes a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception to the stderr log file or to the Java™ dump file on thread creation.
For example 

"java/lang/OutOfMemoryError" "Failed to create a thread: retVal
-1073741830, errno 132 (0x84), errno2 -1055784930 (0xffffffffc112001e)"

Probable causeTHE MEMLIMIT and REGION size defined would be lesser than the actual amount required.

ActionIncrease the MEMLIMIT and REGION size for CICS transaction gateway as per the configuration.
