JSON web services assistant fails with JCL error
The JSON web services assistant JCL fails if characters // are
present in column 1 of the STDPARM DD statement.
SymptomThe JSON web services assistant
JCL job output log JESYSMSG contains messages
of the format:  STMT NO. MESSAGE 
       n IEFC662I INVALID LABEL 
       n IEFC605I UNIDENTIFIED OPERATION FIELD 


Probable causeThe // characters
that are used to identify an MVS PDS member or sequential data set
value are present in column 1 within the STDPARM parameter
list. 

ActionEnsure that statement number n in
the JCL specifies an MVS PDS member or sequential data set, and that
the // characters are not present in column 1. For
example, if you continue the LS-RESPONSE parameter
across multiple lines use: LS-RESPONSE=\
 //'USERID.PROJECT.COBOL(RESPONSE)'

JSON web services assistant fails with errno and errno2 values. 
JSON web services assistant fails and displays an error
message that includes errno and errno2 values.
SymptomFor example: the CTGJS2LS assistant
might fail with: CTG8720E Error using temporary workspace: //'user.CICS.SOURCE(PROGRAMREQ)': 
fopen() failed; EDC5047I An invalid file name was specified as a function parameter.; 
errno=47 errno2=0xc00b028e last_op=602 errorCode=0x0


Probable causeError reading from or writing
to an MVS™ PDS member or sequential
data set specified in the JSON web services assistant parameters.

ActionThe string message for errno is
included in the message text. For example: An invalid file
name was specified as a function parameter.
For more
information on the cause of the error, find the errno2 value
in the Language Environment® utility, edcmtext.
For more
information about edcmtext, see Using edcmtext to obtain information about errno2
values in the IBM® z/OS® Language Environment Debugging
Guide.
For example: edcmtext 0xc00b028e
 The
file name argument passed to fopen() or freopen() was
not valid. This failure is specific to the first pass name parsing
when it is known that the file name cannot be a UNIX file. In this example, the JSON web services
assistant is unable to write the generated language structure to the MVS PDS member specified on the LS-REQUEST parameter,
because the member name specified exceeds the eight character limit
for MVS PDS member names.
