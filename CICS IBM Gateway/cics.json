Gateway daemon not able to access load library
When starting the Gateway, a CEE3250C ABEND S806 message
is issued if the Gateway daemon cannot access the CICS EXCI load library.
SymptomThe following message is generated
when starting the Gateway:  
CEE3250C The system
or user abend S806  R=00000004 was issued. From entry point MVS_CcicsInit
at compile unit offset -FFFF8D84 at address 1AEB158C.

Probable causeThe Gateway daemon cannot
access the CICS® EXCI load library.

Action

Check the STEPLIB environment variable setting and modify it if
necessary. For more information, see Environment variables: local and remote mode for more information. Also
check that the user ID is authorized to access the CICS EXCI load
library.

CTGRRMS services fails to initialize
CICS® Transaction Gateway might
fail to start the CTGRRMS services if the CTGRRMS version is incompatible.
SymptomMessage CTG8659E with return code
1792 is issued.
If
CICS Transaction Gateway V7.2 or V8.0 is used with a V6.1, V7.0, or
V7.1 CTGRRMS, the following message is also written to the system
log: IEF170I 1 CTGRRMS  IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT 269 
SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=0C4  REASON CODE=00000011  
... 
ACTIVE LOAD MODULE       ADDRESS=1AD00048 OFFSET=0000117C    
 NAME=CTGINIT 


Probable causeThe return code 1792 might indicate
that SCTGLINK installed with a version V6.1, V7.1 or V7.2 of CICS Transaction Gateway is
specified on the LNKLST and CICS Transaction Gateway Version
7.2 or 8.0 is used.
ActionConfigure the LNKLST to refer to the
SCTGLINK  data set that is installed with the release of the Gateway
daemon you are using. See Starting CTGRRMS services for more information.
When multiple releases of the CICS Transaction Gateway are
installed on the same IBM® z/OS® image,
the LNKLST must refer to the SCTGLINK that is installed with the latest
release of the CICS Transaction Gateway.

Address space fails to initialize
If CTGRRMS is not running on the IBM® z/OS® image
and ctgasi is used to call it, CTGRRMS might fail to start.
SymptomThe following messages are issued:
CTG6201I
ctgasi - CTGRRMS Services Address Space Initiator. 
CTG6200I
ctgasi - CTG6200I (C) Copyright IBM Corporation 2005.  All rights
reserved. 
CTG6237I ctgasi - starting
up services address space. 
CTG6216E
ctgasi - ASCRE failed for CTGINIT, Post value = FFFFFFFF. 
CTG6255E
ctgasi - timed out waiting for address space to initialize. 
CTG6240E
ctgasi - the version of CTGINIT may be incompatible with ctgasi.

Probable causeCTGRRMS service is not starting because CTGINIT on the LNKLST
is at the wrong version. CTGRRMS is trying to reuse an LX value
that is corrupt.  You can further diagnose this by checking the MVS™ System Log for an 052 abend from
the CTGRRMS process.  If this dump is taking place, probably with
a reason code of 0512, (in R15 for the dump), the reserved LX value
might be corrupt.
The timeout and post value of FFFFFF might indicate that the version
of SCTGLINK referred to in the LNKLST is for a CICS® Transaction Gateway V6.1, V7.0 or V7.1
and a ctgasi is for a V7.2 or later of the CICS Transaction Gateway. CTGRRMS is trying
to reuse an LX value previously used for the CTGRRMS
services and the LX value is in use by another
process.  This might be due to a previous CTGRRMS process not terminating
completely, or completing but not releasing the LX value.


There
are two reasons why the message CTG6255E might be returned:CTGRRMS service is not starting because CTGINIT on the LNKLST
is at the wrong version.
CTGRRMS is trying to reuse an LX value that is corrupt. You can
further diagnose this by checking the MVS System
Log for an 052 abend from the CTGRRMS process. If this dump is taking
place, probably with a reason code of 0512, (in R15 for the dump),
the reserved LX value might be corrupt. 



ActionChange the LNKLST to refer to a SCTGLINK PDS from the same version
of the Gateway as the ctgasi tool. When multiple releases of CICS Transaction Gateway are installed
on the same LPAR, SCTGLINK and ctgasi from the latest installed version
must be used.
First check there is no CTGRRMS process running. If there is,
force the process to end and retry. If the problem persists you can
renew the LX value by starting CTGRRMS again using
the force option: ctgasi -f. This removes the
old LX value and a new value is chosen. Because a limited number of
LX values available on a IBM z/OS image,
do not use this option unless there is no alternative.  When all the
LX values have been used you must IPL the IBM z/OS image
before new services, including CTGRRMS services, can be started.

CICS Transaction Gateway fails
to initialize after an ARM restart
If CICS® Transaction
Gateway stops and if ARM (IBM® z/OS® Automatic
Restart Manager) is configured for cross-system restarts, it attempts
to restart CICS Transaction
Gateway on a different IBM z/OS image
within in the same sysplex.
SymptomCICS Transaction
Gateway fails to initialize following an Automatic Restart Manager
(ARM) restart.

Probable causeIf IBM z/OS fails,
a whole group of related subsystems and applications also fail. ARM
can restart all the failed systems automatically, in a predefined
order, on a different IBM z/OS image
within the sysplex. This is called a cross-system restart.
In
this situation, IBM z/OS has
failed and ARM has performed a cross-system restart of CICS Transaction Gateway on a different IBM z/OS image
in the same sysplex.

ActionModify the ARM profile for the ARM_ID
to prevent cross-system restarts.
For more
information, see: IBM z/OS V1R4.0 MVS™ Setting Up a Sysplex (SA22-7625-05).

CTGRRMS fails to start when XA support is active
If XA support has been activated, the Gateway daemon and
CTGRRMS might not start.
SymptomThe CICS® Transaction Gateway fails

not be started.

 END OF SYMPTOM DUMP 
Follow the steps in Enabling CTGRRMS services to add the module
to the LNKLST.
If a network failure occurs, the transaction
is rolled back if the Java™ Transaction
API (JTA) specification allows this. If the state of the transaction
does not allow the transaction to be rolled back, the transaction
manager repeatedly attempts to open new connections and reissue requests.
The transaction manager rolls back the transaction or completes the
transaction, depending on the state when the error occurs. In this
situation, the transaction manager is responsible for rolling back
or completing the transaction.

Gateway daemon fails to shut down 
During the initiation phase of a normal shutdown, some
calls and requests prevent the shutdown from completing.
SymptomThe
Gateway daemon fails to shut down normally (quiesce) or fails to shut
down in the expected time.

Probable causeOutstanding logical units
of work from ECI or EPI requests that are waiting to complete, prevent
the Gateway daemon from quiescing.

ActionWait for the API calls to complete.
 The following API calls do not block a normal shutdown of CICS® Transaction Gateway: ECI_GET_REPLY_WAIT
ECI_GET_SPECIFIC_REPLY_WAIT
EPI_GET_EVENT and waitState is EPI_WAIT (an EPIRequest.getEvent
call that has its second parameter set to EPI_WAIT causes the request
object to wait for events)


If there are any active applications or tasks in "wait" state
in CICS, you must investigate
these. For example, to query a CICS task
that is in "wait" state, use the CEMT INQ TASK command.
For more information about tasks that are in "wait" state see the CICS Transaction
Server Library.
If
normal shutdown fails you can promote this to an immediate shutdown.
For more information about normal shutdown  see Stopping the CICS Transaction Gateway.
