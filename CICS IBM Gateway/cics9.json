
Version compatibility problem with CTGRRMS
If CICS® Transaction
Gateway and the active CTGRRMS PC services have different versions, CICS Transaction Gateway terminates
with a CTG9215E error.
SymptomCICS Transaction
Gateway terminates and the following error message is issued:
CTG9215E
CICS TG version different from the active CTGRRMS PC services 

Probable causeThe version of the CICS Transaction Gateway that
 you are using is not the same as the version of the CTGRRMS service
address space that is running on the IBM® z/OS® image.
The executable code for CTGRRMS is supplied in CTGINIT which is shipped
with CICS Transaction Gateway.
If the version of CTGINIT is incremented at a new release of CICS Transaction Gateway, you must
refresh CTGRRMS to start using the new version.
ActionEnsure that the versions of the CICS Transaction Gateway and
the CTGRRMS services are the same. See Refreshing CTGRRMS services for information
on how to do this.
