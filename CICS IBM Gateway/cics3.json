SSL problems
SSL connection problems are reported to Java™ client applications via message CTG6651E.
CTG6651E Unable to connect to the Gateway daemon:
[address = IP address , port = port ] [error ]CTG6651E Unable to connect
to the Gateway daemon: [address = IP address , port = port ] [error
]
If an SSL exception occurs, enable stack tracing in the CICS® Transaction Gateway.
Stack tracing indicates what was happening when the exception occurred.
It also provides information about the configuration, such as the
value of the CLASSPATH environment variable. If this does not give
you enough information to diagnose the problem, obtain a standard
trace and contact your IBM® support
organization.
For more information see Exception stack tracing.

128-bit encryption problem
An encryption error might occur if the cipher suite is
not specified correctly in the CICS Transaction
Gateway configuration file.
Application receives an access denied exception
An application configured to connect to the Gateway daemon
using SSL is not able to read from the file system containing the
keystore.
SSL handshake failure

Security error due to surrogate checking problem
An ECI_ERR_SECURITY_ERROR -27 can occur if  a user ID is
not authorized as a surrogate for the user ID specified on the ECI
request.
SymptomAn ECI_ERR_SECURITY_ERROR -27 security
error is issued.

Probable causeSurrogate checking has been
enabled in the EXCI options table DFHXCOPT but the user ID under which
the CICS Transaction Gateway is running is not authorized as a surrogate
for the user ID specified on the ECI request. The SURROGCHK option
in the DFHXCOPT table enables surrogate checking. The default is YES;
see Customizing EXCI options.
 The method used by the CICS® Transaction Gateway to
authenticate user ID and password, when AUTH_USERID_PASSWORD is set,
changed with Version 5.0. Previously surrogate user checking was not
performed even if the SURROGAT option was set in the DFHXCOPT options
table on CICS.
This change causes ECI requests to fail with a -27 security error
if surrogate user checking is enabled and the user ID under which
the CICS Transaction Gateway is running is not authorized as a surrogate
for the user ID specified on the ECI request.

ActionSee the CICS Transaction
Server for IBM® z/OS® External
Interfaces Guide and CICS Transaction
Server for IBM z/OS RACF® Security Guide for
more information about surrogate user checking.

Security error due to RACF problem
An ECI_ERR_SECURITY_ERROR -27 can occur if RACF® program control is not active for the CICS® Transaction Gateway load library.
SymptomAn ECI_ERR_SECURITY_ERROR -27 security
error occurs.

Probable cause
RACF program control is not active for the CICS Transaction Gateway load library
SCTGLOAD, and the CICS Transaction
Server for IBM® z/OS® SDFHEXCI
load library. RACF program
control must be active for the CICS Transaction Gateway load library
 SCTGLOAD, and the CICS Transaction Server for IBM z/OS SDFHEXCI
load library.

ActionActivate RACF program control:SETROPTS CLASSACT(PROGRAM)
RDEFINE PROGRAM * UACC(READ)
SETROPTS WHEN(PROGRAM)
 To add the CICS library when program control is active:
RALTER PROGRAM * ADDMEM('hlq.SDFHEXCI'/volser/NOPADCHK)
SETROPTS WHEN(PROGRAM) REFRESH
To add the CICS Transaction
Gateway library when program control is active: RALTER PROGRAM * ADDMEM('hlq.SCTGLOAD'/volser/NOPADCHK)
SETROPTS WHEN(PROGRAM) REFRESH


Additional informationSecurity errors can
also be caused by:Extended attributes settings are incorrect for certain HFS files.Extended
attributes for HFS files of the <install_path>/bin directory
are set  during the SMP/E installation process. However, if they are
subsequently  modified, program control might be compromised. Use
the ls -E command from  the USS shell command line
to verify that extended attributes are set correctly.
The following extattr commands
mark the load modules used by the CICS Transaction Gateway as program
controlled. Issue commands similar to the following from an OMVS shell
or a Telnet session: extattr +p <install_path>/bin/lib*.so
extattr +ps <install_path>/bin/ctgstart

The
Java SDK must also be program controlled. By default, the SDK is installed
as program controlled. If necessary issue the following commands: extattr +p javapath/bin/*
For
31 bit Java you also need to issue these commands:extattr +p javapath/lib/s390/*
extattr +p javapath/lib/s390/j9vm/*
extattr +p javapath/lib/s390/default/*
For
64 bit Java you also need to issue these commands:extattr +p javapath/lib/s390x/*
extattr +p javapath/lib/s390x/j9vm/*
extattr +p javapath/lib/s390x/default/*
extattr +p javapath/lib/s390x/compressedrefs/*
where javapath is
the location of the JVM. For further information, see Configuring for client certificate mapping.


Running ctgstart from the USS command line with AUTH_USER_PASSWORD
set.To perform the necessary security calls to verify passwords,
the Gateway daemon must run in a program controlled address space.
 Under the USS shell, the first non-program controlled program that
runs (for example ls) makes that particular USS address
space "dirty", and unable to subsequently run program controlled code.
Therefore,
if you intend to run the Gateway daemon by executing the ctgstart
 script directly from a USS shell, set environment variable _BPX_SHAREAS
to NO. This ensures that the Gateway daemon runs in a separate "clean"
address space.
Note: This is in direct contrast to the setting
of _BPX_SHAREAS used when executing the Gateway daemon via CTGBATCH.

The CICS Transaction Gateway failed to authenticate the user ID
and password specified in the ECI call. If user IDs and passwords
are not to be authenticated within the CICS Transaction Gateway ,
ensure the variable AUTH_USERID_PASSWORD is not set in the CICS Transaction
Gateway  STDENV file or shell environment.

The JAVA_PROPAGATE environment variable has not been set for a
CICS Transaction Gateway  application running in local mode. You
must set:  JAVA_PROPAGATE=NO
 in the environment
under which the application runs.
If the environment variable
is not set,  IBM z/OS traces
show that a pthread_security_np call with the CREATE_SECURITY_ENV
parameter has failed with a 157 (EMVSERR) return code.

Program control error with security enabled
An error can occur if security is enabled and a load module
is not program controlled.
SymptomThe following message is issued:
CTG6876E
EXCI error: Function Call = function, Response
= response, EXCI Reason = return code,
Subreason field-1 = return code, subreason field-2
= return code, ctg_rc=error
with
EXCI Reason=631.
You will also see system log entries similar
to this: 
ICH422I THE ENVIRONMENT CANNOT BECOME
UNCONTROLLED. 	
CSV042I REQUESTED
MODULE MODULE NOT ACCESSED. THE MODULE IS NOT PROGRAM
CONTROLLED 	
BPXP014I ENVIRONMENT
MUST REMAIN CONTROLLED FOR DAEMON (BPX.DAEMON) PROCESSING. 

Probable causeSecurity is enabled (AUTH_USERID_PWD
is set to YES) and the load module MODULE is
not program controlled. The system log messages are repeated if more
than one load module is affected.

ActionEnsure
that the load module is program controlled. For information about
which load modules need to be program controlled if security is enabled
see Configuring for client certificate mapping.

User not authorized to access DFHAPPL profiles
A problem might occur in the CICS® address
space because a user is not authorized to access DFHAPPL resources.
SymptomAn
ECI_ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR return code and the following message:
DFHFC0400 applid This
CICS system is not authorized to provide shared access to data tables
- reason code X'code'. 

Probable causeThis error is generated in
the EXCI code if the user ID of the CICS Transaction Gateway host
address space is not permitted to the DFHAPPL.dfhjvpipe or
the DFHAPPL.applid facilities.
CICS
tried to open a data table but the table could not be shared with
other CICS systems because a security check for update access to the
resource name DFHAPPL.applid failed. The value
of the reason code, X'code', provides further
information on the reason for the failure of the security check.
