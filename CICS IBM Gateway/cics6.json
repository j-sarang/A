Dumping diagnostic information
Dumps contain diagnostic information that can be used when
investigating system problems. Various options are available when
obtaining dumps.
Dump options are available for use with the MVS™ system command /F <JOBNAME>,APPL=DUMP.
To
get help on the available dump options, issue the following command: /F <JOB_NAME>,APPL=DUMP,?

If the IBM® JVM is used, a subset of the
options can be used to provide JVM dumps. The IBM JVM can produce a Java™ heap dump, a Java dump,
or a Java system dump. These
are produced by a running JVM, and can be requested during typical
operation of the CICS® Transaction
Gateway. The dumps contain diagnostic information that can be used
when investigating system problems.
For further information
on IBM JVM dumps, see the IBM Java Diagnostic
Guide at IBM Java Diagnostic Guide.

ParametersThere are no short forms of the
parameter names.
Option
Description


ALL

the configuration of CICS Transaction
Gateway.

Failure to handle a Java exception
If an application or CICS® Transaction Gateway fails
to handle a Java™ exception,
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
writes a Java stack dump. This
applies to Java exceptions in
general.
SymptomThe JVM has written a Java stack dump.

Probable causeAn application or CICS Transaction Gateway failed
to handle an exception.

ActionThe destination for the dump output
depends on your JVM implementation; check your Java documentation for more information.

To increase the information written to the Java stack dump, disable the Just-In-Time (JIT)
compiler. The information included in the dump might include the line
of Java source code where the
exception happened. How you disable the JIT compiler depends on your
JVM implementation; check your Java documentation
for more information.
The following example shows a Java stack
dump that was created with the JIT compiler disabled:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
        at java.lang.Thread.start(Native Method)
        at com.ibm.ctg.server.ThreadManager.createObject
           (ThreadManager.java:345)
        at com.ibm.ctg.server.ThreadManager.<init>(ThreadManager.java:131)
        at com.ibm.ctg.server.ManagedResources.<init>
           (ManagedResources.java:106)
        at  com.ibm.ctg.server.JGate.main(JGate.java:895)
If the CICS Transaction Gateway handles
an exception, a Java stack dump
is written only if tracing is enabled. Try to reproduce the problem
with tracing enabled because it helps to show you what was happening
before the exception occurred. For more information, see Tracing.

Java class cache problems
Gateway daemon reports Java™ errors
during initialization and, when -Xshareclasses option nonfatal is
not specified, fails to start.  
SymptomSome, or all, of the following messages
are written to the CICS® TG
job log: JVMSHRC022E Error creating shared memory region 
JVMSHRC336E Port layer error code = -302 or -308 
JVMSHRC337E Platform error message: EDC5111I Permission denied. 
JVMSHRC028E Permission Denied

INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO OPEN

Probable causeCICS Transaction Gateway uses Java class caching and the user ID starting
the Gateway daemon should have the relevant permissions to allow the
user ID to create, or use existing, Java shared
resources in the /tmp/javasharedresources directory. If the user ID
starting the Gateway daemon does not have the relevant permissions
some, or all, of the messages above are written to the CICS TG job log. CICS Transaction Gateway specifies
the -Xshareclasses option nonfatal, which ensures
that failure to access the Java shared
class cache resources does not prevent the Gateway daemon from starting.
If the -Xshareclasses option nonfatal is removed,
the Gateway daemon will fail to initialize if it cannot access the Java shared class cache resources. 
This
might occur if the Gateway daemon is started by different user IDs
that do not have the correct permissions to access the shared class
cache resources in the /tmp/javasharedresources directory.  

ActionEnsure that all user IDs starting
a Gateway daemon have the correct permissions to access the tmp/javasharedresources
directory and the Java shared
class cache resources. See Configuring Java shared classes for details
of how to configure CICS TG
with Java class caching.  
For
more information see your Java documentation.

Unable to load class that supports TCP/IP
If Java attempts to use class files from the local file
system, this contravenes security rules and generates an exception.
SymptomThe following error occurs when
running applications:  
java.io.IOException: CTG6664E
Protocol tcp not supported 

Probable causeYou are using a Web browser
and CICS® Transaction Gateway on
the same workstation, and the ctgclient.jar and ctgserver.jar are
referenced in the CLASSPATH setting.
Java searches the CLASSPATH
environment variable before downloading classes across the network.
If the required class is local, Java attempts to use it. However,
use of class files from the local file system contravenes the application
security rules, and generates an exception.

ActionEdit the CLASSPATH setting to remove
ctgclient.jar and ctgserver.jar.
