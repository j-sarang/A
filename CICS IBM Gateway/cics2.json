Port is in use by another task
A permission denied error occurs if a port
that CICS® Transaction Gateway attempts
to use is already in use by another task.
SymptomThe following error message is displayed:
EDC5111I
PERMISSION DENIED

Probable causeThe port that CICS Transaction
Gateway is attempting to use is already in use.

ActionDo one of the following: Enforce the exclusive use of the port for this CICS Transaction Gateway job. You
can reserve a port for a given jobname in TCPIP.PROFILE. Reconfigure
the address space that is already using the required port so that
it uses a different port, then restart.
Configure the Gateway daemon to use a different port number.

Conflict exists with a default port 
A conflict exists between a default port used
by CICS® Transaction Gateway for
one of its supported protocols and another port that is already in
use.
SymptomOne or more protocols fail to start
successfully and the following message is generated:
CTG6525E
Unable to start handler for the protocol:protocol,
port:port, because:[RC]



Possible causeA conflict might exist between
the CICS Transaction Gateway default port and a port that is already
in use.

ActionChange the port number in the configuration
file (ctg.ini). For more information, see Configuring a remote mode topology.

Attempting connection to CICS on
wrong TCP/IP port
If CICS® Transaction
Gateway attempts to connect to CICS on
the wrong TCP/IP port an error occurs.
SymptomThe following error is returned:
ECI_ERR_NO_CICS

Probable causeThe CICS server is listening on a different TCP/IP
communications port to the one through which CICS Transaction Gateway is attempting the connection.
This is because the SERVER section of the CICS Transaction Gateway configuration file
(ctg.ini) is specifying the wrong port number.

ActionCheck which port the CICS server
is listening on. To check the port an IPIC TCPIPService is defined
to listen on in CICS Transaction
Server: 
On TSO option 6, issue the command: NETSTAT ALLCON (APPLD *CISS*

On
USS, issue the command: netstat -a -G *CISS*

This
example shows that the IPIC TCPIPService is listening on port 50889
and also that an IPCONN is in use. The generated IPCONN name is 00000007.

Change the port number in the configuration file (ctg.ini). For
more information, see Port.

EXCI connection problems
Problems when connecting to CICS® over
EXCI.




EXCI pipe limit exceeded
A problem with error ECI_ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR can occur if
the EXCI pipe limit is exceeded during communication between CICS servers. This is due to an MVS™ system pipe limit.
Pipe limit exceeded for available sessions
A failure with error CTG6882E can occur if CICS Transaction Gateway tries
to allocate more pipes than the number of available sessions defined
in the CICS sessions definition.
This is due to a CICS Transaction
Gateway system pipe limit.
