Shortage of EXCI resources on the CICS server
An error can occur if there is a shortage of CICS® receive sessions.
SymptomIntermittent ECI_ERR_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE
messages when sending an ECI request to CICS.

Probable causeThere are not enough receive
sessions in the sessions definition.

ActionIncrease the RECEIVECOUNT value on
the SESSIONS resource definition on the CICS server
to a value substantially greater than is theoretically necessary.
Do this by setting RECEIVECOUNT to a value greater than the LOGONLIM
value. For more information, see CICS server sessions definition.

Shortage of IPIC resources on the CICS server
An error can occur if there is a shortage of IPIC resources.
SymptomIntermittent ECI_ERR_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE
errors occur when sending an ECI request to CICS® over IPIC.

Probable causeAll the defined sessions
for the connection are in use. Each active session uses one CICS task, and the maximum number
of sessions allowed is 999. CICS Transaction
Gateway allocates 300 KB of memory for each session. If all the defined
sessions are in use, any new requests receive an ECI_ERR_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE
error.

ActionIn remote mode topologies, increase the SENDSESSIONS value
in the CICS Transaction Gateway
configuration file (ctg.ini).
In local mode topologies using JEE, increase the value of the ipicSendSessions property
in the connection factory configuration.
In local mode topologies using Java™ base
classes, use the CTG_IPIC_SENDSESSIONS Java property to set the maximum
number of IPIC send sessions.
Increase the IPCONN ReceiveCount value in CICS.
Increase the Java heap size.
