
Web service connection closes as soon as HTTP request is sent
When an application attempts to send a web service request
to the Gateway daemon, the connection to the Gateway daemon is dropped
if an incorrect port is used.
SymptomThe HTTP or HTTPS connection between
the web service client application and the Gateway daemon is closed
as soon as a web service request is sent. If connection logging is
enabled, the following message is written to the Gateway daemon error
log:CTG6507I Client disconnected: <connection details>, 
	reason = CTG6656E Incorrect data <data> received on the network connection 
	between the Gateway daemon and client application


Probable causeThe web service
client application attempted to send a web service request to the
Gateway daemon TCP, SSL or statistics API port, instead of the HTTP
or HTTPS port.

ActionCorrect the web service client application
to send web service requests to the Gateway daemon HTTP or HTTPS port.
